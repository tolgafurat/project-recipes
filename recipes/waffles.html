      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>You likely already have all the ingredients you'll need for this waffle recipe. If not, here's what to add to your grocery list: </p>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li><strong>2 large eggs: </strong>This waffle recipe starts with two whole eggs, whisked until light and fluffy.</li>
        <li><strong>2 cups all-purpose flour: </strong>All-purpose flour adds gluten, which gives the waffles structure. You can also use whole wheat flour.</li>
        <li><strong>1 3/4 cups milk: </strong>Whole milk lends richness and moisture. Plus, it helps create the ideal batter consistency.</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 cup vegetable oil: </strong>A neutral oil, such as vegetable oil, ensures the waffles are nice and moist.</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon white sugar: </strong>A tablespoon of white sugar adds the perfect amount of sweetness.</li>
        <li><strong>4 tablespoons baking powder: </strong>Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it contributes to the waffles' light and fluffy texture.</li>
        <li><strong>1/4 teaspoon salt: </strong>A pinch of salt enhances the other flavors. Don't skip this step!</li>
        <li><strong>1/2 tablespoon vanila extract: </strong>A dash of vanilla adds complexity and enhances the overfall flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Nonstick cooking spray: </strong>You'll need to spray the iron with nonstick cooking spray before you start making the waffles.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How to Serve Waffles</h2>
      <p>Pair these waffles with classic breakfast fare (think scrambled eggs, bacon, or yogurt). If you're serving them for lunch or dinner, consider serving them with fried chicken! Chicken and waffles is never a bad idea, after all.</p>
      <h2>How to Store Waffles</h2>
      <p>Allow the leftover waffles to cool, then transfer them to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator for up to three days. For best results, reheat in a toaster or toaster oven.
      <h2>Can You Freeze Waffles?</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can freeze waffles for up to three months. Arrange them in a single layer on a baking sheet and flash freeze for a few hours or up to overnight. When the waffles are frozen solid, transfer them to an airtight container or freezer-safe bag. There's no need to thaw â€” reheat them the way you would store-bought frozen waffles (in the toaster or microwave).</p>
