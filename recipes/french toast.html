      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <p>Every home cook has their own twist on basic French toast, but most variations contain the following ingredients:</p>
      <ul class="ingredients">
        <li><strong>2/3 cup milk </strong></li>
        <li><strong>6 thick slices bread: </strong>Thick-cut bread is the base for all French toast. Sturdy, dense, slightly stale slices absorb the custard-like egg mixture better than thin, airy ones.</li>
        <li><strong>2 large eggs: </strong>When it comes to French toast, eggs are essential. The proteins solidify once they're heated, which binds the batter together and ensures a rich texture. The fat, meanwhile, adds extra creaminess.</li>
        <li><strong>1 teaspoon vanilla extract (Optional) and 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon (Optional): </strong>The best French toast is warm, cozy, aromatic, and sweet. The cinnamon and vanilla in this recipe are optional, but we definitely recommend using them for the most delicious experience. You could even add a little nutmeg or sugar if you feel like it.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt: </strong>Don't skip the salt! Just a pinch won't affect the flavor. Salt helps break down the eggs, incorporate them into the batter, and prevents egg chunks in the finished product.</li>
        <li><strong>1 tablespoon unsalted butter, or more as needed: </strong>Like so many of the most decadent foods, the best French toast is made with butter. If your French toast has the tendency to burn, try frying the batter-soaked bread in a combination of butter and oil.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Best Bread For French Toast</h3>
      <p>The best breads for French toast are brioche, sourdough, French bread, or challah. These varieties are dense and sturdy enough to handle total saturation in the wet, milky, egg custard without falling apart. However, in a pinch, any thick-sliced white bread will do.</p>
      <p>French toast is traditionally made with day-old slices because they absorb the eggy mixture better than fresh ones (and this method prevents waste, it's a win-win). Of course, a slightly stale loaf is certainly not a requirement. If you only have fresh bread on hand, that'll work just fine.</p>

      <h2>How to Store French Toast</h2>
      <p>Let your leftover French toast cool completely, then place it in an airtight container (such as a zip-top bag or a reusable storage container). Store it in the fridge for about one to three days.</p>
      <h2>Can You Freeze French Toast</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can freeze a big-batch of French toast for up to three months. Arrange the slices in a single layer on a baking sheet, freeze for at least four hours or up to overnight, then store frozen French toast in a freezer-safe container for two to three months. When you're ready to eat it, just throw it on a baking sheet and bake at 375°F until hot and cooked through, about 8-12 minutes.</p>
