          <h2>How to Make Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
          <ol class="how-to-list">
            <li><strong> Make the dough: </strong>Whisk the dry ingredients in a medium bowl. In a separate bowl, beat the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs and vanilla. Add the dry mixture to the wet mixture, then stir in the oats. Cover and chill for at least one hour (this step is important to prevent spreading!).</li>
            <li><strong>Roll the cookies: </strong>Roll the chilled dough into balls and place the balls on baking sheets. Dip a fork in water, then in sugar. Use the fork to flatten each dough ball.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake the cookies: </strong>Bake in the preheated oven until the edges are golden brown and the centers are nearly set. Cool on the baking sheet for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack.</li>
          </ol>
          <p><strong>Optional mix-ins: </strong>Raisins, dried cranberries, white chocolate chips, chocolate chips, walnuts, pecans, or shredded coconut</p>

      <h2>How to Store Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
      <p>Allow the oatmeal cookies to cool completely before storage. Transfer the cooled cookies to an airtight container and store at room temperature for up to four days.</p>
      <h2>Can You Freeze Oatmeal Cookies</h2>
      <p>Yes, you can freeze baked or unbaked oatmeal cookies for up to three months.</p>
      <p>Freeze the baked cookies in a freezer-safe container or zip-top bags with parchment paper between each layer.</p>
      <p>Flash freeze the unbaked cookie dough balls for at least a few hours. When the balls are frozen solid, transfer them to a zip-top freezer bag and squeeze out the excess air. Bake according to the recipe, but add a few extra minutes to account for the frozen temperature.</p>
